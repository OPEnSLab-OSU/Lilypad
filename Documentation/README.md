## Abstract

Fresh water is becoming one of the most valuable resources in the world. The Lilypad aims to provide live data to assist in water loss prevention and water management. The Lilypad aims to be a low cost alternative to traditional methods of long term monitoring. To assist water management the Lilypad collects water temperature, air temperature, air humidity, and Solar Energy per square meter logging the data locally to a SD card and sending the data over 4G for live monitoring.

1. ## Hardware in Context

Without deploying a whole weather station to a lake how are you supposed to know the rate of water loss? The Lilypad hopes to give water shed management groups and researchers alike the ability to monitor the rate of water loss. This is critical for allocating resources appropriately to prevent excess water loss due to evaporation. Deploying shade balls or other measures is costly and providing data on where they are most needed can help conserve the most valuable resource we have, fresh water.

Using our current sensor suite is not a traditional ways of measuring water loss. [LGSONIC](https://www.lgsonic.com/products/monitoring-buoy/) sells a floating water quality monitoring suite that can have additional sensors added to measure water loss. The other option is to build a weather station and measure local conditions to model water loss.

2. ## Hardware Description

The Lilypad is a floating platform for long term water sensing. Using three thick acrylic panels the Lilypad captures two buoys, a solar panel and electronics box. Leaving mounting points for sensors, counterweights, and deployment. Using laser cutting to capture, orient, and provide structure to the components of the buoy allows us to cut costs significantly.
